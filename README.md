# Crypto-Trend-Checker
A Crypto-Trend-Checker in Python is a tool that analyzes cryptocurrency price data to identify and visualize market trends, helping traders make informed decisions. 
Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how it might work:

Components
Data Collection:

Use APIs from cryptocurrency exchanges (like Binance, Coinbase, or CoinGecko) to fetch real-time or historical price data.
Data Processing:

Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and converting timestamps.
Trend Analysis:

Implement algorithms to detect trends, such as moving averages, Bollinger Bands, or Relative Strength Index (RSI).
Consider using machine learning for predictive modeling, such as ARIMA or LSTM.
Visualization:

Utilize libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly to create visual representations of trends and price movements.
User Interface:

A command-line interface or a simple graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter or Streamlit for user interaction.
